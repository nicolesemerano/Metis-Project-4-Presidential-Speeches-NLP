# Metis-Project-4-Presidential-Speeches-NLP

This project came about during my time at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  We were tasked with applying our skills in Natural Language Processing.  I decided to combine those skills with my knowledge of history and research if there were any trends or themes with various official speeches Presidents made over the years.  I scraped majority of the speeches from the Miller Center out of the University of Virginia.  To hear more of my explination of the project, check out my article at

.

For now, here's a breakdown of everything in this respository:
* Presidential_NLP.ipynb :  Get a look at the actual Python code I used to create this project.  It should open/download as a Jupyter Notebook.
* GW_wordCloud.png : One of the Word Clouds I created in this project.  You can also see this in both the Jupyter code and the PowerPoint presentation
* President-Tableau.twb : Access to the Tableau file I created.  It contains both a Bar Graph and TreeMap
* President_sentiment.csv : This is the CSV I created to display my information in Tableau.
* Presidential_Speeches NLP.pptx : These are the slides for the presentation I showcased at Metis Data Science that summarizes the information.
* Speech_heatmap.png :  The HeatMap showcases how prevelent the top topics in the Presidential speeches were across each decade in American History

Enjoy!
